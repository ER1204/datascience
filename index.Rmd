Hello, 806!

This is **Holly** - she's about 3 years old and loves the summer heat (you can take a dog out of Texas but you can't take the Texas out of a dog). Originally adopted in the winter of 2020, she was very quiet, lethargic, and shy. She's since grown quite vocal and protective, but is still a very chill dog (aside from the 10-20 minutes of her daily "zoomies" when she remembers she loves to run). She gets along well with the neighborhood dogs, who are jealous that she's well trained enough to be off-leash more often than not.

Here she is in her iconic _"shrimp"_ posture, which is her preferred sleeping position.
